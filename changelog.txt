Version: 0.69.99
Date: ????
  Changes:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.98
Date: 2025-08-12
  Changes:
    - More long term fix to the issues from 0.69.95-97 on stack overflow. There are now more safeguards in place to stop this from ever happenning again.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.97
Date: 2025-08-11
  Changes:
    - Added emergency failsafe to the stack overflow bug.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.96
Date: 2025-08-11
  Changes:
    - Shattered planet mod support:
      ► Crapapult can now be placed on the shattered planet.
      ► New cross tech for shattered planet.
    - Added diagnostics to technology prerequisite search.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.95
Date: 2025-08-10
  Changes:
    - More text added for multiplayer.
    - More lore.
    - Readme/info now shows which planet mods for which Rubia has cameo technologies.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.94
Date: 2025-08-09
  Changes:
    - Tenebris is now explicitly locked behind Rubia by default. This is toggleable via mod settings (just like locking Aquilo behind it). Realistically, you will only notice if you have Tenebris + a mod that deletes Aquilo.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.93
Date: 2025-08-08
  Changes:
    - Long stack insterter recipe is no longer locked to Rubia.
    - Rubia pressure 50 hbar => 80 hbar, gravity 2=>2.4 m/s^2. This improves robot energy usage: 4x => 3x.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.92
Date: 2025-08-04
  Changes:
    - Buffed huge asteroids so sniper turrets cannot kill them. I basically multiplied the HP/flat res of huge asteroids AND railgun ammo by 10x.
    - Nerf: Sniper turret cooldown: 180 => 200 frames. This should minimally affect Rubia, but have a much bigger nerf for super-spamming them in space.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.91
Date: 2025-08-01
  Changes:
    - Icons for unique compatibility recipes for Krastorio 2 Spaced out are now distinguishable.
    - Vanilla galore continued module recipes are now added to the Moshine-Rubia cross tech.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.90
Date: 2025-07-28
  Changes:
    - Future-proofed some recipe category changes vs vanilla, as there are plans to replace all the "or" categories. The only material impact this should have is that Corrundum's catalytic plant loses access to holmium craptalysis, which is a recipe it was never supposed to have.
    - Planet portal linked belts now banned from Rubia.
    - Added explicit wind speeds to more mod planets.
    - Crushing industry recycling compat fix about recycling sand.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.89
Date: 2025-07-27
  Changes:
    - Added freezing mechanics for most Rubia entities (for Aquilo etc). If this breaks a base, sorry not sorry. I also included heating energy for things that are normally locked to Rubia, just in case you use a mod that removes surface conditions, or mods that have other mechanics (eg Sniper turrets on Cerys). Heat energy changes from 0kW:
      ► Already had frost: wind turbine, biorecycling plant, long stack inserter
      ► Long bulk insterter => 50kW
      ► Crapapult => 200 kW
      ► Sniper turret => 50 kW
      ► Garbo grabber => 200 kW (why you'd ever need this outside Rubia, idfk).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.88
Date: 2025-07-26
  Changes:
    - Long stack inserter HP 160 => 400. I had forgotten to give it better stats.
    - Wind turbine max HP 200 => 250. A slight little buff, since these are on the outskirts usually.
    - Garbo grabber max HP 1000 => 600.
    - Biofused promethium science tech cost reduced: 1M => 100k. This should make it more viable to get this for less mega-basey setups.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.87
Date: 2025-07-25
  Changes:
    - Reworded the planet briefing... again!
    - Another megabasing tip added
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.86
Date: 2025-07-23
  Changes:
    - Renamed Operation Crap Man, because that name sucked.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.85
Date: 2025-07-23
  Changes:
    - Fixed fast replace group of long stack inserters.
    - New biofusion tech: +1 Cargo landing pad. This should aid with how limitted cargo landing pads are on Rubia in post game.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.84
Date: 2025-07-17
  Changes:
    - Better long term fix for BZ-tin compatibility with a new rocket silo recipe.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.83
Date: 2025-07-15
  Changes:
    - Fixed bug where trashsteroid shadows would permanently exist on your map.
    - Preparing for wind turbine UPS improvement.
    - Fixed incompat with BZTin messing with rocket silo recipe, leading to a softlock.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.82
Date: 2025-07-13
  Changes:
    - Made some yeetibng recipes visible in factoriopedia to help new players.
    - Added tips and tricks section:
      ► Crapapult
      ► Rocketizer
      ► Craptonite wall
      ► Garbo grabber
    - Made nicer debug functions.
    - Trashsteroid speed now fluctuates (it was supposed to before)
    - Bugfix for players being removed from multiplayer games (reported by DoubleThought).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.81
Date: 2025-07-12
  Changes:
    - More crushing industry compat.
    - Compat with both K2SO + bzcarbon at the same time.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.80
Date: 2025-07-11
  Changes:
    - New Recipe: Biofusion science can now be used to make promethium science with fewer promethium chunks.
    - Biochamber productivity bonus has been made more granular. 10 ranks of +5% instead of 5 ranks of +10%. It's also more expensive now for the top rank.
      ► Everyone's research rank has been migrated to avoid any lost progress.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.79
Date: 2025-07-10
  Changes:
    - Fixed lore typo
    - Added 4 new lore entries. Including some hazards.
    - Added a cooldown to lore, so you don't get bombarded with many prompts at once.
    - Forcing everyone up in version for some dependencies that fix bugs.
    - Slight UPS optimization for trashsteroids.
    - Factorissimo fix
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.78
Date: 2025-07-06
  Changes:
    - Fixed crash that happened when super force building rails on Rubia.
    - Planned to come soon: Biter egg productivity research added to biofusion science.
    - Planned to come soon: Biolab pollution reduction research.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.77
Date: 2025-07-06
  Changes:
    - Made Krastorio 2 SO compatibility code more stable for other mods being included.
    - Improved contrast of mod thumbnail.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.76
Date: 2025-07-05
  Changes:
    - Version up of machine upgrades, to force in the bug fixes.
    - Fixed old Rubia icon in Operation Iron Man.
    - New Rubia sprites. Thanks, nullevoy.
    - If K2SO is installed, then buff projectiles to make up for the issues in slower projectiles.
    - Now issues warnings for gun mods that make Rubia much more difficult.
    - Buffed main theme song rate +50%.
    - Wind turbine color on map now blackish.
    - Nutrient productivity tech cost 1.5^L => 1.8^L, making it cost +20% per rank.
    - Biochamber prod bonus cost (2^L => 3^L) * 1000. Now max rank costs 243k instead of 32k
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.75
Date: 2025-07-03
  Changes:
    - Added wind checks to super force building. Thanks to lesbian_mami for her cyubersyn code, and lord thy god for guiding me through her BP library!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.74
Date: 2025-07-02
  Changes:
    - [BREAKING CHANGE] Removed Rubia-specific recipe for refined concrete. You no longer need it because of the following change. 
    - [BREAKING CHANGE] Made craptonite walls easier to make locally, by changing the recipe. These changes are to the end goal of minimizing the total number of Rubia recipes for simplicity.
      ► Craptonite wall recipe inputs: 1 craptonite frame + 10 refined concrete => 1 craptonite frame + 20 concrete + 8 iron stick
    - Paracelsin is now locked by default behind a Rubia clear. This behavior can be toggled in mod settings.
    - Banned several teleporters from Rubia. Generally, teleporters that let you automatically move items left are hard banned. Teleporters that let you manually bring items into Rubia before clearing it just had recipes banned (so you can still use them, but only after clearing Rubia). This isn't an exhaustive ban, but it gets some of the really popular ones.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.73
Date: 2025-06-29
  Changes:
    - New recipe to make refined concrete locally on Rubia.
    - Ligma charm now works on lumber mill from age of production.
    - Fixed a bug where crapapult was not allowed on space platforms made before new versions of Rubia were installed.
    - Rubia postgame tech now needs lube barrels instead of light oil barrels, because some people would unlock it accidentally, without even noticing.
    - Improved stability with Blueprint Shotgun. Rubia's blueprint shotgun ammo recipe now has a superscript to make it more clear.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.72
Date: 2025-06-28
  Changes:
    - Yet another crushing industry compat fix. Third time is the charm! This one fixes when a bunch of other mods change the load order.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.71
Date: 2025-06-28
  Changes:
    - Crushing industry compatibility when the concrete mix setting is turned off.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.70
Date: 2025-06-28
  Changes:
    - Crushing Industry compatibility
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.69
Date: 2025-06-26
  Changes:
    - Nice version :)
    - Trashsteroid trajectory has been changed: Trashsteroid speed x2, friction x20ish, lifetime +12%. This causes them to cover a lot of ground, and be slow towards the end of their trajectory. This makes them easier to hit, and buffs craptonite walls because trashsteroids now cover about 1.6x as much distance.
    - Crapapult is now allowed outside Rubia, on surfaces that allow space voiding. This comes with additional balance changes:
      ► Crapapult yeet recipes involved with research are now surface-locked to Rubia. Yeeting related items on other surfaces will NOT advance research.
      ► New "asteroid density" surface condition restricts crapapult to Rubia, space, or Cerys. Units are now ppb
      ► Crapapult can now be exported from Rubia. Rocket capacity 0 => 1. 
      ► Crapapult stack size 10 => 5. Sorry.
      ► Crapapult recipe is still surface locked to Rubia.
    - Landing cutscene warnings are now more accurate.
    - I can now more accurately estimate the amount of damage you can regen, leading to more accurate estimates for landing on Rubia.
    - Compat for Lignumis when alternate electronic circuit recipes demand wood.
    - Compat for AAI Industries. Both circuit recipe and chemical plant are now available.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.68
Date: 2025-06-24
  Changes:
    - Forcing everyone up in prerequisite versions.
    - Trashsteroids now damange vanilla construction robots by a flat 100 damage, which exactly kills them at normal quality, while always letting quality bots live (at all difficulty).
    - Janus cross tech nerf: Time Distorter speed +50% => +30%
    - Removed some unused code.
    - Fixed random lore, where it was not actually randomizing some of the lore. Ooops!
    - Resource Spawner Overhaul compatibility.
    - Corrundum tech nerf: Charcter craft speed +100% => +50%. In combination with other techs, this was getting handcrafting to be too good relative to automation, which is unhealthy. I'm hitting this one because it is the biggest offender.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.67
Date: 2025-06-21
  Changes:
    - Machine Upgrades crashes fixed. Now forcing everyone to come up to a stable version.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.66
Date: 2025-06-21
  Changes:
    - Putting out a version where machine-upgrades is optional while I figure out bugs that affect a small set of users.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.65
Date: 2025-06-20
  Changes:
    - NEW machine upgrades mod just released! This mod allows technologies to give a global module effect to all machines of a given type. Using this new mod, we have some new technologies:
      ► New biochamber productivity tech
      ► New cross tech for Janus
      ► New cross tech for Lignumis / Wooden Universe
      ► New cross tech for Paracelsin
      ► New cross tech for Tiberian Dawn
      ► New cross tech for Secretas & Frozeta
      ► Cross tech for Muluna has been buffed to give a bonus to all crushers.
      ► New cross tech for Jahtra (will be enabled when Jahtra is released)
    - Rubia's axe is now needed for Paracelsin's infinite axe technology.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.64
Date: 2025-06-19
  Changes:
    - Removed warning from Biofusion science.
    - I had to ban miniloader-redux from my planet because it kept fighting back at me with its scripting.
    - Fixed issue with ghost adjustable inserters not getting updated.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.63
Date: 2025-06-17
  Changes:
    - Russian locale update.
    - Added new surface conditon: Asteroid density.
    - Fixed incompatibility with Electronic Locomotives
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.62
Date: 2025-06-13
  Changes:
    - BZ mod compatibility
    - Added achievements for difficulty.
    - Added another interface for planet hoppers. He didn't like the names on the first one.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.61
Date: 2025-06-13
  Changes:
    - Added an interface for PlanetHoppers to use to block Rubia access if you don't actually have the gear.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.60
Date: 2025-06-11
  Changes:
    - Russian locale re-reupdated.
    - Trashsteroid character damage 280 => 300 on normal difficulty, because you really should have shields.
    - Buff sniper turret: HP 300 => 600, impact resistance 0% => 30%. This should help with setting up mining outposts.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.59
Date: 2025-06-11
  Changes:
    - Updated list of mods that block you from Rubia postgame content.
    - Updated Russian localization, thanks to Пружинка.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.58
Date: 2025-06-11
  Changes:
    - Lignumis compatibility
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.57
Date: 2025-06-10
  Changes:
    - Krastorio 2 spaced out compatibility. Thanks, Polka!
    - Removed unnecessary global variables for other mods.
    - Infinite quality tiers should no longer horrendously lag the game when mousing over a wind turbine.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.56
Date: 2025-06-07
  Changes:
    - Made Rocketizer description clearer.
    - Resolved incompatibility with distant-misfires mod. Now that it is working, I can see that it makes Rubia vastly more difficult by making all your guns guzzle ammo. Highly unrecommended, but at least you can.
    - Trashsteroid initial speed +10%.
    - Trashsteroid chunks now slightly more visible (less transparency, bigger size).
    - Craptonite walls buffs.
      ► Craptonite walls now block trashsteroids.
      ► Craptonite wall now immune to poison.
      ► Craptonite wall tech cost 500 => 1000 to compensate.
      ► Craptonite walls no longer make an alert when damaged.
      ► Added info to Tips and Tricks, technology, and entity description. Also added version update message to notify people.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.55
Date: 2025-06-07
  Changes:
    - Generalized event library to work with space platforms too.
    - Garbo grabbers now too heavy for a rocket, because why would you want them off of Rubia?
  Balancing:
    - Context: I just beat Rubia again, but on the newly added highest difficulty. I'm making a second pass of balance changes. They are mostly small tweaks that should not break anyone's base.
    - Buffs:
      ► Biorecycling Plant recipe time 10 => 6 (+66% speed)
      ► Crapapult craft time 8 => 7 (+14% speed)
      ► Wind turbine craft time 10 => 8 (+25% speed)
      ► Assisted frothing recipe time 10 => 8 (+25% speed). The current tuning should already be enough to promote people to make some nice designs.
      ► Assisted frothing: Light oil cost 30 => 25 (-17%). When voiding from Junkibacterial Metabolysis of blue chips, I want light oil to be the byproduct to manage.
      ► Cargo pod containers now take fixed damage from trashsteroids to avoid awkward explosions at high difficulties.
      ► Gleba-Rubia distance 15k km => 10k km. I always thought it was 10k until I looked again XD
      ► (Cerys) Plutonium earing tech cost 1000 => 300. It was just far too much.
      ► (Maraxsis) Craptonite lamp tech cost hydraulic science => maraxsis glass. This makes it less samey (and also cheaper). 
    - Nerfs: The goal isn't to weaken anything overpowered, but to incentivise you to make a greater variety of builds pop up across Rubia.
      ► Scrapophilic digestion of cupric scrap input scrapophilus 4 => 5 (+25%). I'm doing this to promote more unique designs here via machine ratios. I was always a little displeased with the middle leg of Ruibia because it felt a little weak/samey. This change should promote solutions with a little more variety. I'm not divulging my solution so you can figure it out.
      ► Scrapophilic digestion of cupric scrap speed -40%. Sorry--I had initially intended the ratio to line up nicely with metallo-coasphyxiation, but that change must have been lost. The newly nerfed recipe has better machine ratios.
      ► Junkibacterial digestion of rails: Concrete output 3 => 4 (+33%). Yes, this is a nerf.
      ► All recipes that make/consume froth now make/consume 2x as much. I know everyone loves brown froth, but you really don't need to stockpile it! XD
      ► Higher sludge costs, because I want to promote branching out to more sludge wells in lategame to postgame (or at least making people module their pumpjacks!).
        ● Sludge => Nutrients sludge cost 20 => 40 (+100%).
        ● Assisted frothing sludge cost 50 => 100 (+100%).
      ► Junkibacterial digestion of blue chips. Light oil output 20 => 25 (+25%). I feel like voiding the liquid is more interesting of a challenge that I want to bring out.
      ► Ghetto biorecycling science pack craft output 5 => 4 (-20%). The additional time here should mostly give a little more downtime to prep the base for the next stage.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.54
Date: 2025-06-05
  Changes:
    - Unknown techs no longer show a level.
    - Merged train braking force with other mods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.53
Date: 2025-06-05
  Changes:
    - Fixed crash on trashsteroid impact.
    - Dragging everyone up to the most recent factorio version, because I need features from it!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.52
Date: 2025-06-04
  Changes:
    - Thanks to MagistrDjo for a Russian localization!
    - Fixed even more multiplayer desyncs. Thanks Yenon.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.51
Date: 2025-06-03
  Changes:
    - Fixed many multiplayer desyncs. Now it should be multiplayer compatible. Thanks to Yenon for your help testing and bug reporting!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.50
Date: 2025-06-03
  Changes:
    - Armored trains/wagons: HP buffed 2x => 2.5x. 
    - Armored trains/wagons: Braking force buffed 2-10x to be commensurate with their stats... and then a little bit more just to be safe.
    - Armored locomotive fuel efficiency 25% => 20%.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.49
Date: 2025-06-02
  Changes:
    - Added FAQ to mod page.
    - Wooden Logistics Compatibility: If Wooden logistics is installed, then long handed inserters and repair packs are now available in mixed scrap sources.
    - Alloy smelting compatibility: If alloy-smelting has coke mode on, then Rubia now gives electric kilns, and has a new coke recipe.
  Balancing:
    - Firearm mag tech cost 200 => 300
    - Yellow ammo => iron plates is now ~25% faster
    - Spidertron remnant fast inserter yield buffed: 10% 20-25 => 10% 20-40
    - Armored locomotive/wagon: Nerf weight relative to vanilla 4x => 5x.
    - Armored wagons: Buff HP relative to vanilla 1x => 2x
    - Sniper turrets now rotate their head much faster (x1.5). This makes them even better for Rubia.
    - Lore was set forward, because too much of it would bombard you all at once. I set up migration to not replay lines.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.48
Date: 2025-06-01
  Changes:
    - (If you are on the stable branch, then you will not notice any differences until factorio updates next.)There are some changes in the experimental branch that are currently being controlled now, based on your version. Major changes:
      ► Tech hiding is now more inclusive to give better hiding of technologies! Let me know if this messes with anyone's saves.
      ► Rocket logistic requests now get properly set off, to not be misleading on Rubia.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.47
Date: 2025-06-01
  Changes:
    - Factoriopedia simulations for armored trains fixed.
    - Added test functions for Wube for a bug report.
    - Wind turbines no longer have a dumb useless UI when clicked on... usually!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.46
Date: 2025-05-31
  Changes:
    - So... don't be mad, but I fixed a bug that made trashsteroid health not scale as much as it needed when you got high physical damage technology... A totally understandable mistake! But on the bright side, I also added difficulty settings under Mod Settings => Map Settings. If your Rubia base starts suddenly exploding, you should use that! Good luck!
    - Difficulty settings added.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.45
Date: 2025-05-31
  Changes:
    - Compatibility for blueprint shotgun.
    - Marked Krastorio 2 spaced out as an INcompatibility. I made it not crash, but the problem is that it messes with crafting to the point where Rubia is really unplayable. This needs more time dedicated to give specific support, otherwise you just get trapped on the planet.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.44
Date: 2025-05-31
  Changes:
    - Trashsteroid scale inverting settings can now be changed without rebooting the game. So much more convenient!
    - Module icons for biorecycler no longer obscure other machines. Thanks, Bilka.
    - Difficulty options have been implemented, but not yet available. You will be able to change difficulty once I can properly balance the actual difficulty.
    - New achievements, but I'm still working on being able to even test it properly.
    - Maraxsis can now make research vessels with Rubia science.
    - Forgot to credit Hornwitser, who made the quality glassware from which science sprites are derived. Licenses also updated.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.43
Date: 2025-05-29
  Changes:
    - Fixed horrible crash from chunk checker in the new update. Sorry!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.42
Date: 2025-05-29
  Changes:
    - Further optimization to trashsteroid rendering. Lower Rubia time usage.
    - Added a setting to invert how trashsteroids become bigger/smaller as they approach the surface.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.41
Date: 2025-05-29
  Changes:
    - Sniper turret technology icon size did not match. Some users could not load the game.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.40
Date: 2025-05-28
  Changes:
    - Garbo grabber recipe description updated.
    - Fixed issue of craptonite frames not being exportable from Rubia: RocketCargoInsertion is now a required dependency. This adds a machine called the "Rocketizer" that allows rocket parts to be added to it to put rocket parts into a silo's cargo. Support was added to merge.
    - Rocketizer is now immune to trashsteroids, but only if made with craptonite in non-backwards-compatible mode.
    - Added warning about new rocketizer settings if you already have a rocketizer in your base upon installing Rubia.
    - Distant Misfires marked as an incompatibility, until I can find a way to make it not cause the mod to be impossible, lol.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.39
Date: 2025-05-27
  Balancing:
    - Scrap patch richness x3
    - Biofusion science packs can now be exported from Rubia.
    - Biorecycling science pack rocket capacity 1000 => 2000
    - Armored trains no longer go zoom in reverse lol.
    - Spidertron remnants now give 0-4 => 3-7 steel, red circuits 0.25%=>0.3 and 8-12 => 8-15
    - It is currently not possible to automatically export Craptonite Frame from Rubia. This is not intended, and I'm working on it. In the meantime, please download "Rocket Cargo Insertion" from the lovely S6X if you need a workaround (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/RocketCargoInsertion?from=search).
  Compatibility:
    - Incompatibility with "Remove All Cargo Drop Technologies" has been resolved. It is no longer an incompatibility because it no longer causes Rubia to crash. However, the current 1.0.5 version of that mod currently does NOT work to allow you to drop items to Rubia. That is not something that I did, but something MeteorSwarm needs to figure out from his mod side.
    - Impact wagon is now allowed on planet Rubia, and are immune to trashsteroids. Praise Kiplacon-sama

Date: 2025-05-25
  Changes:
    - Rubia productivity per tech level 10% => 5%
    - I did a big rework of the event handling for Rubia. This should make it much easier to expand Rubia the future.

    - Found incompatibility with "Remove All Cargo Drop Technologies". I need to investigate further for a permanent fix. For now, I am marking this mod as an incompatiblity, as it causes crashes upon trying to leave Rubia. I'll consider removing this incompatibility when that is resolved, which requires edits from that mod's creator.
