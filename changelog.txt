Version: 0.69.41
Date: 2025-05-29
  Changes:
    - Sniper turret technology icon size did not match. Some users could not load the game.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.40
Date: 2025-05-28
  Changes:
    - Garbo grabber recipe description updated.
    - Fixed issue of craptonite frames not being exportable from Rubia: RocketCargoInsertion is now a required dependency. This adds a machine called the "Rocketizer" that allows rocket parts to be added to it to put rocket parts into a silo's cargo. Support was added to merge.
    - Rocketizer is now immune to trashsteroids, but only if made with craptonite in non-backwards-compatible mode.
    - Added warning about new rocketizer settings if you already have a rocketizer in your base upon installing Rubia.
    - Distant Misfires marked as an incompatibility, until I can find a way to make it not cause the mod to be impossible, lol.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.39
Date: 2025-05-27
  Balancing:
    - Scrap patch richness x3
    - Biofusion science packs can now be exported from Rubia.
    - Biorecycling science pack rocket capacity 1000 => 2000
    - Armored trains no longer go zoom in reverse lol.
    - Spidertron remnants now give 0-4 => 3-7 steel, red circuits 0.25%=>0.3 and 8-12 => 8-15
    - It is currently not possible to automatically export Craptonite Frame from Rubia. This is not intended, and I'm working on it. In the meantime, please download "Rocket Cargo Insertion" from the lovely S6X if you need a workaround (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/RocketCargoInsertion?from=search).
  Compatibility:
    - Incompatibility with "Remove All Cargo Drop Technologies" has been resolved. It is no longer an incompatibility because it no longer causes Rubia to crash. However, the current 1.0.5 version of that mod currently does NOT work to allow you to drop items to Rubia. That is not something that I did, but something MeteorSwarm needs to figure out from his mod side.
    - Impact wagon is now allowed on planet Rubia, and are immune to trashsteroids. Praise Kiplacon-sama

Version: 0.69.36
Date: 2025-05-25
  Changes:
    - Rubia productivity per tech level 10% => 5%
    - I did a big rework of the event handling for Rubia. This should make it much easier to expand Rubia the future. You should not notice any differences, but if bugs start showing up, please report them. If you have a problem, revert to the previous version of the mod while I fix whatever issue you might have.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.69.35
Date: 2025-05-25
  Changes:

    - Fixed craptonite recycling into... holmium!?
    - Added cross-tech with Cubium.
    - Rubia assets version+ to match with the asset for the Cubium tech.
    - Discovery tree compatibility.
    - Found incompatibility with "Remove All Cargo Drop Technologies". I need to investigate further for a permanent fix. For now, I am marking this mod as an incompatiblity, as it causes crashes upon trying to leave Rubia. I'll consider removing this incompatibility when that is resolved, which requires edits from that mod's creator.

  Changes:
    - First biorecycling recipe nerfed to give -25% copper.
    - Updated trashsteroid factoriopedia entry.
    - Some people were just placing repair kits with no turrets! Can you believe that? So now trashsteroid damage is RNG'd to have a small chance of landing a CRITICAL HIT! Now Rubia is just like a real RPG! :) :) :) A trashsteroid rolls for a critical hit ONCE to damage anything in its range--it does not roll separately.
