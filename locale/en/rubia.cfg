rubia=‚óãüåêDiscover the wind planet Rubia. Your whole factory must go with the wind as a never-ending barrage of waste is hurled at your base. Belts and inserters work differently on Rubia, leading to unique building challenges not seen on any other planet.

[technology-description]
planet-discovery-rubia=A windy planet covered in garbage. Low gravity and high winds constantly pick up wreckage and fling it around at high speed, including in low orbit. Anything dropping from orbit will be bombarded with garbage and take severe impact damage. Normal rockets taking off from the surface are also not safe. Better technology is needed to deal with it. Helpful microbes live on this planet, and allow transforming junk into more useful materials. See "Tips and Tricks" for a planet briefing.
operation-iron-man=Advanced guidance systems and armored pods allow safely dropping cargo pods through Rubia's hostile airspace.

rubia-unknown-technology=You must complete more research on Rubia to see what lies ahead.
rubia-progression-stage1=Become one with the waste. Science is done a bit differently around these parts.
rubia-progression-stage2=Your diligent study of the garbage has led you to discover an unlikely friend--a little guy you tastelessly named [item=rubia-bacteria-B].
rubia-progression-stage3=You've studied the trash. Bathed in it. Been molded by it. You are finally ready to take your junk skills to the next level.
craptonite-processing=Just because you discovered the most durable material in the galaxy, and you can technically name it whatever you want, doesn't mean that you should.
rubia-armored-train=You are finally able to make trains capable of braving the winds of planet Rubia.

rubia-sniper-turret=Noobs upgrade for the longer range. Pros upgrade for the lower UPS and noise.

rubia-long-bulk-inserter=Outfit long-handed inserters with a sturdy craptonite frame that can handle the massive torque of rapidly swinging with large amounts of items.
rubia-long-stack-inserter=Rubia's crown jewel. Using a durable craptonite frame, a heavy uranium base, and flexible carbon fiber grips, this stack inserter can rapidly drop stacks of items farther away. Slower than a normal stack inserter.

craptonite-wall=Use craptonite reinforcement to make the most durable defensive structures in the galaxy.
craptonite-axe=Replace your crappy steel axe with a durable craptonite axe, capable of mining much more efficiently. Unlocks access to various craptonite accessories.

rubia-efficiency-module4=Attaching a craptalytic converter to your machine will enrage the neutrons of any pollution particles passing through, causing them to explode and emit the sweet-smelling aroma of craptonite.
rubia-holmium-craptalysis=Passing the ore through a craptalytic converter offends the holmium atoms, making them more eager to escape and enter solution more efficiently.

rubia-braking-force-8=Your trains are weak, and I have a need for speed.

rubia-biofusion-science-pack=Rubia's final challenge: Making an unholy concoction with the DNA of lifeforms from various planets. Optional. WARNING: NOT TESTED
rubia-biofusion-science-pack-removed=Removing Gleba from your playthrough removes access to Rubia postgame content. Sucks to be you.
rubia-nutrients-from-sludge=Learn to filter and process the useful organics from bacterial sludge for convenient biofuel on Rubia.
rubia-nutrient-productivity=Make nutrients more efficiently.

;Craptonite tools
rubia-craptonite-boots=Craptonite-reinforced boots with holmium alloy trim and soles to aid faster running. Feel the craptonite insoles with every step.
rubia-craptonite-hook=A craptonite bracer with powerful mechanism that shoots a tungsten hook with a chain to reach things from greater distances.
rubia-craptonite-satchel=A sturdy satchel made with strong carbon-fiber and a sturdy craptonite frame to hold more trash.
rubia-craptonite-cannister=Keep a bottle of chilled Gamer Girl Bathwater in a craptonite-reinforced cannister. Chilled with Aquilean cryogenics, one sip will always make you feel energized, but a little sick.
;Other mods
rubia-craptonite-circlet=A powerful craptonite circlet encrusted with a chunk of the galaxy's finest Moshite. You think it helps you commune with machines.
rubia-craptonite-earring=A craptonite earing encrusted with plutonium to keep you warm, and guide neutrons to their proper place.
rubia-craptonite-glove=Gauntlets with platinum catalyst supported on a craptonite substrate to allow you to craft items faster.
