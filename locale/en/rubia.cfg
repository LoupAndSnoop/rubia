[technology-description]
;Anything dropping from orbit will be bombarded with garbage and take severe impact damage. Normal rockets taking off from the surface are also not safe. Better technology is needed to deal with it. 
planet-discovery-rubia=A windy planet covered in garbage. Low gravity and high winds constantly pick up wreckage and fling it around at high speed, including in low orbit. Helpful microbes live on this planet, and allow transforming junk into more useful materials. \n[img=utility/warning_icon]See [font=default-semibold]"Tips and Tricks"[/font] for a planet briefing.
operation-iron-man=Advanced guidance systems and armored pods allow safely dropping cargo pods through Rubia's hostile airspace.

rubia-unknown-technology=You must complete more research on Rubia to see what lies ahead.
rubia-progression-stage1=You discovered a scrap-eating bacteria and named it __ITEM__rubia-bacteria-A__. Science is done a bit differently around these parts.
rubia-progression-stage1B=Become one with the waste. With a rudimentary understanding of the crapapult, you are ready to build your first junkpile of a base.
rubia-progression-stage2=Your diligent study of garbology has led you to discover an unlikely friend--a little guy you tastelessly named __ITEM__rubia-bacteria-B__.
rubia-progression-stage3=You've studied the trash. Bathed in it. Been molded by it. You are finally ready to take your junk skills to the next level.
craptonite-processing=Just because you discovered the most durable material in the galaxy, and you can technically name it whatever you want, doesn't mean that you should.
rubia-armored-train=You are finally able to make trains capable of braving the winds of planet Rubia.

rubia-long-bulk-inserter=Outfit long-handed inserters with a sturdy craptonite frame that can handle the massive torque of rapidly swinging with large amounts of items.
rubia-long-stack-inserter=Rubia's crown jewel. Using a durable craptonite frame, a heavy uranium base, and flexible carbon fiber grips, this stack inserter can rapidly drop stacks of items farther away. Slower than a normal stack inserter.

craptonite-wall=Use craptonite reinforcement to make the most durable defensive structures in the galaxy.
craptonite-axe=Replace your crappy steel axe with a durable craptonite axe, capable of mining much more efficiently. Unlocks access to various craptonite accessories.

rubia-efficiency-module4=Attaching a craptalytic converter to your machine will enrage the neutrons of any pollution particles passing through, causing them to explode and emit the sweet-smelling aroma of craptonite.
rubia-holmium-craptalysis=Passing the ore through a craptalytic converter offends the holmium atoms, making them more eager to escape and enter solution more efficiently.

craptonite-productivity=Your naming privileges are hereby revoked. We're calling this one "Rubia Productivity", and you're going to like it.
rubia-braking-force-8=Your trains are weak, and I have a need for speed.

rubia-biofusion-science-pack=Rubia's final challenge: Making an unholy concoction with the DNA of lifeforms from various planets. Optional. WARNING: NOT TESTED. PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK!

;Other mods
rubia-craptonite-circlet=A powerful craptonite circlet encrusted with a chunk of the galaxy's finest Moshite. You think it helps you commune with machines.
rubia-craptonite-earring=A craptonite earing encrusted with plutonium to keep you warm, and guide neutrons to their proper place.
rubia-craptonite-glove=Gauntlets with platinum catalyst supported on a craptonite substrate to allow you to craft items faster.
