[mod-description]
rubia=○🌐Discover the wind planet Rubia. Your whole factory must go with the wind as a never-ending barrage of waste is hurled at your base. Belts and inserters work differently on Rubia, leading to unique building challenges not seen on any other planet.

[technology-description]
planet-discovery-rubia=A windy planet covered in garbage. Low gravity and high winds constantly pick up wreckage and fling it around at high speed, including in low orbit. Anything dropping from orbit will be bombarded with garbage and take severe impact damage. Normal rockets taking off from the surface are also not safe. Better technology is needed to deal with it. Helpful microbes live on this planet, and allow transforming junk into more useful materials. See "Tips and Tricks" for a planet briefing.
operation-iron-man=Advanced guidance systems and armored pods allow safely dropping cargo pods through Rubia's hostile airspace.

rubia-progression-stage1=Become one with the waste. Science is done a bit differently around these parts.
rubia-progression-stage2=Your diligent study of the garbage has led you to discover an unlikely friend--a little guy you tastelessly named [item=rubia-bacteria-B].
rubia-progression-stage3=You've studied the trash. Bathed in it. Been molded by it. You are finally ready to take your junk skills to the next level.
craptonite-processing=Just because you discovered the most durable material in the galaxy, and you can technically name it whatever you want, doesn't mean that you should.
rubia-armored-train=You are finally able to make trains capable of braving the winds of planet Rubia.
rubia-project-trashdragon=Make armored rockets capable of withstanding the intense barrage of debris found in Rubia's airspace.

rubia-scrapapalooza=Much better than Scraptoberfest.
rubia-sniper-turret=Long range firepower.

rubia-long-bulk-inserter=Outfit long-handed inserters with a sturdy craptonite frame that can handle the massive torque of rapidly swinging with large amounts of items.
craptonite-wall=Use craptonite reinforcement to make the most durable defensive structures in the galaxy.
craptonite-axe=Replace your crappy steel axe with a durable craptonite axe, capable of mining much more efficiently.

rubia-efficiency-module4=Attaching a craptalytic converter to your machine will enrage the neutrons of any pollution particles passing through, causing them to explode and emit the sweet-smelling aroma of craptonite.
rubia-holmium-craptalysis=Passing the ore through a craptalytic converter offends the holmium atoms, making them more eager to escape and enter solution more efficiently.

craptonite-productivity=Your naming privileges are hereby revoked. We're calling this one "Rubia Productivity", and you're going to like it.
