[recipe-description]
biorecycling-science-pack=Make a dubious mixture to study the garbage.


platinum-plate=Platinum plates in the foundry.
platinum-plate-production-alt=Platinum plates in the furnace!
catalytic-chemical-plant-recipe=Produce a chemical plant that specializes in using platinum as a catalyst for reactions.
pressurized-acid-neutralization=Even higher pressures on rubia let us get even more energy from acid neutralization.
pressurized-acid-neutralization-alt=We need more water to capture all energy released, but this should help get things started
dilute-acid-neutralization=We get enough heat energy from neutralization to boil water.
hot-water-to-steam=Just a bit more energy to turn hot water into 500 degree steam
petroleum-alkylation=Large amounts of sulfuric acid can form carbocations, which are used as the basis for alkylation to form new carbon-carbon bonds.
light-oil-alkylation=Large amounts of sulfuric acid can form carbocations, which are used as the basis for alkylation to form new carbon-carbon bonds. We use this form heavy oil.
sulfur-combustion=Burning sulfur lets us get this gas, which we can use to make both sulfuric acid and water.
hydrogen-sulfide=With a platinum catalyst, we can use petroleum to hydrogenate sulfur to get hydrogen sulfide
sulfur-reduction=Sulfur is reduced to a zero oxidation state, while water is formed
sulfurous-oxidation= In the presence of a platinum catalyst, sulfur-dioxide can react with the oxygen to form sulfur trioxide in situ. Sulfur trioxide then reacts with water to form sulfuric acid
hydrogen-sulfide-combustion=Combustion of hydrogen sulfide gives us more components to make sulfuric acid.
chalcopyrite-refining=Chalcopyrite is FeCuS. We blast the ore heat and concentrated sulfuric acid fully oxidize the metals, forming a mixture of their aqueous sulfate salts.
reactive-displacement=Iron is more reactive than copper. Thus we can use it to displace copper ions in solution.
force-reduction-iron=We can use voltage to pump electronics into the ionic solution. These electrons reduce aqueous ferric ions in to pure iron. The pure product must be shaped back into plates.
force-reduction-copper=Similiar to reduction of ferric sulfate, we pump electrons in and they reduce copper ions.
sulfonated-plastic=With a platinum catalyst, we use sulfur dioxide and oxygen to form sulfur trioxide. Sulfur trioxide reacts with sulfuric acid to form fuming sulfuric acid, which can sulfonate hydrocarbons.
sulfonated-plastic-production-alt=With a platinum catalyst, we use sulfur dioxide and oxygen to form sulfur trioxide. Sulfur trioxide reacts with sulfuric acid to form fuming sulfuric acid, which can sulfonate hydrocarbons.
calcium-sulfate-fish=With a nitrogen and phosphorous source, we add more carbon and calcium sulfate to optimize nutrient production.
calcium-sulfate-bioflux= With a nitrogen and phosphorous source, we add more carbon and calcium sulfate to optimize nutrient production.
calcium-sulfate-egg=With a nitrogen and phosphorous source, we add more carbon and calcium sulfate to optimize nutrient production.
calcium-sulfate=With a nitrogen and phosphorous source, we add more carbon and calcium sulfate to optimize nutrient production.
sulfuric-acid-dilution=Add acid to water to dilute safely, not the other way around.
sulfuric-acid-concentration=We spend alot of energy boiling off water into steam, which can be condensed back into water.
sulfuric-acid-concentration-alt=We spend alot of energy boiling off water, and do not bother to condense it
calcium-sulfate-production-alt=Sulfur-dioxide and calcium carbonate react to form calcium sulfate and carbon dioxide
stone-production=Stone is represented by SiO2 (reactant) and CaSiO3 (product). Analagous to making stone on Vulcanus.
asphalt-production=We condense heavy oil into a concrete precusor.
asphalt-production-alt=We can also use excess light oil to make asphalt. Reaction is faster, but less efficient.
concrete-production-from-asphalt=Asphalt and stone makes concrete.
pressure-laboratory-recipe=Combine a chemical plant and laboratory and steam turbine to get a pressure cooker - for science!
thruster-fuel-oxidizer-to-steam=Burn thruster fuel to make steam!
carbon-dioxide-to-carbon=Reduce carbon dioxide to carbon with iron.

calcium-sulfate-recovery=Recover calcium sulfate from nutrients with frequent washes to remove non polar molecules.
destructive-dilute-acid-neutralization=Heat the water, and boil it away.
rocket-fuel-catalytic-chemistry=Same recipe - just in a faster machine!
super-saturated-displacement=We can coax more copper out of a mixed solution with repeated supersaturation and recrystalization.
super-saturated-displacement-iron=Super saturated displacement with iron
sulfur-poison-capsule=Upgraded chemical warfare.
blue-rocket=More explosive rocket, stuffed with a powerful new explosive.
sulfuric-oxidizer=Sulfonate a hydrocarbon product so it has lots of oxygen groups - allowing it to react as an oxidizing agent for explosive reactions.
explosives-from-sulfuric-oxidizer=Package Sulfuric oxidizer into a bundles of explosive.
petrol-dehydrogenation-and-combustion=With a platinum catalyst, we can use it to dehydrogente hydrocarbons to get alkynes, and alkenes and hydrogen gas. This is an endothermatic process that requires high pressures, so it takes time. After dehydrogenation, we completely combust the unsaturated products to get carbon dioxide
petrol-dehydrogenation-and-combustion-maraxsis=We supply the O2!

[technology-description]
planet-discovery-rubia=A windy planet covered in garbage. Low gravity and high winds constantly pick up wreckage and fling it around at high speed, including in low orbit. Anything dropping from orbit will be bombarded with garbage and take severe impact damage. Normal rockets taking off from the surface are also not safe. Better technology is needed to deal with it. Helpful microbes live on this planet, and allow transforming junk into more useful materials.

platinum-thruster=Make a thruster that can withstand the heat from consuming incredible amounts of fluid
calcium-sulfate-recovery=Recover calcium sulfate from excess nutrients. First we use light oil as our organic phase, and water as our aqueous phase in our secretory funnel.

We then use sulfuric acid to crash calcium sulfate out of solution, and use more water for a recrystalization to purify the calcium sulfate crystals.
