[technology-description]
planet-discovery-rubia=A windy planet covered in garbage. Low gravity and high winds constantly pick up wreckage and fling it around at high speed, including in low orbit. Anything dropping from orbit will be bombarded with garbage and take severe impact damage. Normal rockets taking off from the surface are also not safe. Better technology is needed to deal with it. Helpful microbes live on this planet, and allow transforming junk into more useful materials.

platinum-processing=Refine platinum ore into bars
catalytic-chemical-plant=Produce a chemical plant that uses platinum as a catalyst and as anode/cathode for electrochemistry
electrochemical-science-pack=Make electrochemical science pack
sulfur-redox1=Make hydrogen sulfide.
sulfur-redox2=Produce sulfur and hydrogen sulfide 
sulfur-redox3=Produce sulfuric acid from sulfur dioxide and water
sulfate-processing-1=Convert excess hydrogen sulfide into sulfur dioxide.
sulfate-processing-2=Convert chalcopyrite into usable materials.
sulfur-dilution-concentration=Concetrate and dilute sulfuric acid
sulfonated-plastic=Make plastics with fuming sulfuric acid and a carbon source
calcium-sulfate=Make calcium sulfate
calcium-sulfate-nutrients=Make more nutrients
stone-production=Make stone
asphalt-and-concrete=Asphalt and concrete
pressure-laboratory=Make a fast research lab that uses uncommon and above science packs. Normal quality science packs inside the machine will be consumed every 0.75 seconds while it is active.
space-steam-production=Use thruster fuel and thruster oxidizer for a controlled combustion, turning water into steam.  
dry-ice-production=Cool carbon-dioxide into its solid form: dry ice. Dry ice can be used in an ice box to keep bioflux,eggs,and agricultural science at 50% spoilage. It only works in the icebox. 
recrystalization=Dissolve excess plates into solution,so they can be recrystalized out of solution into ores
platinum-thruster=Make a thruster that can withstand the heat from consuming incredible amounts of fluid
calcium-sulfate-recovery=Recover calcium sulfate from excess nutrients. First we use light oil as our organic phase, and water as our aqueous phase in our secretory funnel. With time, ions from nutrients diffuse into in the aqueous phase, while the oil layer contains all the organic material. We then use sulfuric acid to crash calcium sulfate out of solution, and use more water for a recrystalization to purify the calcium sulfate crystals.
rocket-fuel-catalysis-productivity=Increases rocket fuel produced with the Catalytic Chemical Plant (light oil + fuel). Does not boost other means of rocket fuel production. 
blue-rocket=Use sulfuric acid to shove lots of sulfate groups on solid fuel, such that it can act as a compact oxidizer for rockets. 
chalcopyrite-processing=Process chalcopyrite into iron and copper.
