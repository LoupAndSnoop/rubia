[mod-description]
rubia=○🌐Discover the wind planet Rubia. Your whole factory must go with the wind as a never-ending barrage of waste is hurled at your base. Belts and inserters work differently on Rubia, leading to unique building challenges not seen on any other planet.

;Anything dropping from orbit will be bombarded with garbage and take severe impact damage. Normal rockets taking off from the surface are also not safe. Better technology is needed to deal with it. 
planet-discovery-rubia=A windy planet covered in garbage. Low gravity and high winds constantly pick up wreckage and fling it around at high speed, including in low orbit. Helpful microbes live on this planet, and allow transforming junk into more useful materials. \n[img=utility/warning_icon]See [font=default-semibold]"Tips and Tricks"[/font] for a planet briefing.

rubia-craptonite-hip-replacement=With questionable methods, replace your hip's cartillage with a durable craptonite ball joint, secured to your bones with Jahtran titanium. The stronger joint lets you carry heavier loads [font=default-tiny-bold]with a few disfiguring side effects.[/font]
rubia-craptonite-codpiece=Boost your self-confidence with a shiny gold codpiece that gaudily protects your precious jewels with a craptonite frame. It serves as a constant reminder to always make the best use of what you have, even if it isn't as big as you hoped.

[rubia-taunt]
forgot-roboport-failsafe=(Loup&Snoop) You forgot to bring a personal roboport to Rubia. Check your inventory.
forgot-roboport-failsafe-part2=(Loup&Snoop) And that roboport isn't free. I'm eating your left leg as compensation.

rubia-first-blast-off-part1=(Rubia): And so the engineer blasted off in his crappy rocket, eager to discover more materials and planets, excited to give them names even worse than on Rubia.
rubia-first-blast-off-part2=(Rubia): There is truly no place in the cosmos safe from this menace.
rubia-first-blast-off-part3=(Loup&Snoop): Congrats on beating Rubia. I always doubted you.
rubia-first-blast-off-part4-mp=(Loup&Snoop): Oh, I see what happened here. Thanks to everyone for being so kind as to carry __1__ to victory. He wouldn't have made it without you.
rubia-first-blast-off-part5-mp=(Loup&Snoop): No, really. __1__ was idle for over an hour while everyone else did most of the work.

;WIP (unused)
rubia-shield-warning-convo-part1=(exfret): There's no way he'll figure it out. He's too stupid.
rubia-shield-warning-convo-part2=(Loup&Snoop): I want to believe
rubia-shield-warning-convo-part3=(exfret): he'll definitely splat lmao
rubia-shield-warning-convo-part4=(Loup&Snoop): no no no. he'll turn back. just look!

[version-change-warnings]
rubia-trashsteroid-health-scaling=(Loup&Snoop / Rubia): So... don't be mad, but I fixed a bug that made trashsteroid health not scale as much as it needed when you got high physical damage technology... A totally understandable mistake! But on the bright side, I also added difficulty settings under Mod Settings => Map Settings. If your base starts suddenly exploding, you should use that. Good luck!
rubia-craptonite-wall=(Loup&Snoop / Rubia): Good news! Craptonite walls were buffed in a recent update. See details in their technology, or in Tips and Tricks.
rubia-craptonite-wall-recipe=(Loup&Snoop / Rubia): Notice: The recipe for craptonite walls has been changed, and the Rubia-specific recipe for refined concrete has been removed.
rubia-factorissimo-destruction_warning=(Rubia): Factorissimo factories on Rubia will be destroyed in __1__ minutes. Downgrading will cause a crash.
;rubia-factorissimo-destruction-position=Factorissimo factories on Rubia moved to: [gps=__1__,__2__,__3__]
rubia-bzmod-silo-recipe-change=(Rubia): Warning: Rubia just made a change to rocket silo recipes for the BZ mod package. The base silo recipe now uses solder again.

rubia-tangible-projectile-mod-warning=(Loup&Snoop / Rubia): Warning. You are currently using a mod that makes bullets actual projectiles (distant misfire). This makes Rubia substantially more difficult than intended.
rubia-tech-cost-multiplier-warning=(Loup&Snoop / Rubia): Notice: You are playing with tech cost multipliers, but Rubia has the default x1. Rubia trigger technologies have their own separate tech cost multiplier, controlled in mod startup settings. This is totally optional--just letting you know. This message won't appear again.

rubia-briefing=[img=utility/warning_icon][img=utility/warning_icon][color=250,250,0][font=default-semibold]WARNING![/font][/color][img=utility/warning_icon][img=utility/warning_icon]  Passengers in cargo pods will suffer SEVERE impact damage upon entering Rubian airspace. Safely landing on Rubia requires you to be able to withstand a large amount of impact damage, or else [color=250,250,0][font=default-semibold]YOU WILL DIE UPON LANDING[/font][/color]. The prerequisites of [technology=planet-discovery-rubia] allow crafting everything needed to land. After beating Rubia, [technology=planetslib-rubia-cargo-drops] enables free travel without the requisite gear.\n\n[planet=rubia] is a trash planet with constant hurricane-force winds. The wind restricts the orientation of several entities, and will constantly barrage the surface with trashsteroids. The planet is covered in resource-rich scrap, which can be converted to useful materials using microbes in a [entity=biorecycling-plant]. Heavy amounts of atmospheric debris prevent rockets from safely launching without [technology=rubia-project-trashdragon], and block cargo pods from sending supplies without [technology=planetslib-rubia-cargo-drops].
rubia-trashsteroid-tips=Trashsteroids are ever-present threats on Rubia:\n   • [entity=medium-trashsteroid] will bombard your base, and require turrets to defend against.\n   • Falling trashsteroids deal damage with a small chance to land a critical hit, which is rolled once per trashsteroid.\n   • [entity=cargo-pod] will suffer SEVERE impact damage upon entry, without [technology=planetslib-rubia-cargo-drops].\n   • [entity=rocket-silo] cannot safely launch rockets without [technology=rubia-project-trashdragon].\n   • [entity=garbo-grabber] can only collect [item=craptonite-chunk] from trashsteroids destroyed by physical/explosive damage within their range.\n   • Some entities are immune to bombardment, such as [item=rail], [entity=rail-signal], [entity=rubia-armored-locomotive], related entities, and any entity made with [item=craptonite-frame].\n   • [entity=craptonite-wall] block the movement of trashsteroids, but cannot spawn-block them. The walls are immune to their impact, but other entities caught in the AOE still take damage as normal.\n   • [technology=physical-projectile-damage-1]/[technology=weapon-shooting-speed-1]/etc will make [entity=medium-trashsteroid] bulkier. Higher tech levels still give you a substantial advantage--just not as massive of an advantage as you would expect.\n   • Rubia mod difficulty settings scale trashsteroid health and damage dealt.\n\n[font=default-semibold]Megabasing/UPS Tips:[/font]\n   • Not looking at Rubia will greatly lower Rubia's UPS cost, as a large fraction of time is spent on rendering trashsteroids.\n   • Trashsteroids only spawn in chunks containing something vulnerable to them OR chunks within player vision.\n   • Do not fear exploring large swaths of Rubia's surface. I spent weeks optimizing trashsteroids to avoid spending CPU time on unnecessary chunks of the map.
rubia-wind-tips=Eastward winds will have the following effects:\n   • [entity=inserter] and [entity=splitter] can only move items to the right.\n   • [entity=transport-belt], [entity=underground-belt], and [entity=electric-mining-drill] cannot move items to the left.\n   • [entity=logistic-robot] cannot safely navigate to [entity=requester-chest], [entity=buffer-chest], [entity=active-provider-chest], or [entity=rocket-silo].\n   • [entity=locomotive], [entity=cargo-wagon], [entity=recycler], and related cannot withstand the wind.\n   • [entity=rubia-wind-turbine] will generate power.\n\n-----------\nFull list of entitites banned on Rubia: 
rubia-crapapult-tips=[entity=crapapult] can destroy [color=250,250,0][font=default-semibold]almost any item[/font][/color] by shooting it out into Rubia's winds.\nMany technologies are researched by shooting a large number of a specific item. The crapapult is NOT a military building.
rubia-garbo-grabber-tips=Using physical/explosive ammunition to destroy a [entity=medium-trashsteroid] within range of a [entity=garbo-grabber] allows it to collect [item=craptonite-chunk].
rubia-craptonite-wall-tips=[entity=craptonite-wall] can block the movement of [entity=medium-trashsteroid].
