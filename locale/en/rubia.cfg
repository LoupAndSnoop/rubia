[technology-description]
planet-discovery-rubia=A windy planet covered in garbage. Low gravity and high winds constantly pick up wreckage and fling it around at high speed, including in low orbit. Anything dropping from orbit will be bombarded with garbage and take severe impact damage. Normal rockets taking off from the surface are also not safe. Better technology is needed to deal with it. Helpful microbes live on this planet, and allow transforming junk into more useful materials. See "Tips and Tricks" for a planet briefing.
