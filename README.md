# Rubia

You find yourself on a planet with perpetual hurricane-force winds that have erroded all life. It is a hostile junkyard where the elements constantly hurl large masses of garbage at anything that dares peek above the ground. But on this planet, there is something *living* under the debris--something microscopic. It don't just survive the barrage, but feasts on it! Will you master the art of biorecycling and become the king of the crapheap? Or will the winds blow you back to Nauvis?

## Features

- Unique Mechanics:
    - The wind mechanics *completely* change how you build a base on Rubia by altering how belts and inserters can work on the surface. 
    - Trashsteroids will bombard your base. Plunder them with new machines to gain access to Rubia's most precious resource.
    - Wind power is mostly free to let you focus on the above.
- Rubian crafting is themed around recycling junk with bacteria. Recyclers are banned on Rubia to make way for totally different recycling chains focusing on highly customizable base designs.
- Custom music and a cutscene.
- Rewards are balanced for a standard Space Age playthrough. Rewards include special inserters and trains, and several handy upgrades that make the planet worth clearing.

## Rubia is for you If:

- You want factory-assembling challenges/puzzles that focus on how you can place belts/inserters to accomplish a goal.
- You want to make a customizable base where you can use creative combinations of recipes to rig up different supply chains/setups.
- You want to add more content to a Space Age playthrough (even if it already started) with a planet that feels and plays totally differently.
- You want an Ultracube-style humorous vibe, but with a fraction of the wit.
